About DocHub
------------

DocHub is one of those tools that quietly transforms how you handle documents without forcing you to learn an entirely new system. At its core, it's a comprehensive document management and eSignature platform that works seamlessly with Google Drive, Dropbox, and other cloud storage services.

What makes DocHub stand out in the crowded document software market? It's the perfect balance between power and simplicity. You can edit PDFs, add electronic signatures, create fillable forms, and collaborate with team members—all within your browser. No clunky downloads, no confusing interface, just straightforward functionality that actually works.

Users particularly love DocHub for its intuitive design. The learning curve is practically non-existent, which means you can onboard your entire team in minutes rather than days. Freelancers appreciate the flexibility of the free plan for occasional documents, whilst growing businesses lean into the Pro plan for unlimited signing capabilities and advanced features like the AI Assistant and Bulk Send.

The platform handles everything from simple signature requests to complex document workflows involving multiple stakeholders. Whether you're signing a rental agreement, sending contracts to clients, or managing internal approvals, DocHub keeps everything organised and legally compliant. Plus, the fact that it integrates beautifully with tools you're already using (Gmail, Google Workspace, etc.) means it slots right into your existing workflow without disruption.

Why This Black Friday Sale Is Worth It
--------------------------------------

Let's be straight about this—DocHub doesn't do sales often. In fact, this Black Friday promotion is their only discount event of the entire year. That alone should tell you something about the value proposition here.

Here's the maths that matters: If you opt for the Pro plan monthly at the regular price, you're looking at $16 per month, which totals $192 annually. With the 20% Black Friday discount, that same plan drops to $12.80/month for an entire year—saving you a solid $38.40. That's not pocket change, especially when you consider the unlimited document signing, AI assistance, and premium tools you're getting access to.

For the Basic plan, the savings work similarly. Regular monthly pricing sits at $11, but with the discount, you're paying $8.80/month for 12 months. That's nearly $27 saved over the year.

What I personally find appealing is the structure of this offer. Monthly subscribers aren't getting a one-off discount—they're locking in the reduced rate for a full 12 billing cycles. That gives you a whole year to properly integrate DocHub into your workflow and see the real ROI before renewals kick in at standard rates.

If you've been on the fence about upgrading from the free plan or switching from a competitor like DocuSign or Adobe Sign (both of which can be considerably pricier), this is genuinely the best window to make that move. The 20% off essentially gives you nearly two and a half months free over the course of a year.

Plans & Pricing Breakdown
-------------------------

DocHub keeps their pricing refreshingly straightforward. Here's what each tier offers and what you'll actually pay during this Black Friday sale:

**Regular Price:** $0 (always free)

**What's Included:**

*   5 eSignatures per month
*   3 Sign Requests per month

This is the sweet spot for solo entrepreneurs or small businesses that have moved beyond "occasional" into "regular" document work. The unlimited completed documents mean you're not constantly watching a counter, and premium tools give you editing capabilities that make PDFs actually manageable.

### Pro Plan

The complete package for growing businesses with serious document workflows.

**Regular Monthly Price:** $16/month **Regular Annual Price:** $12/month (billed annually) **Black Friday Discount:** 20% off for 12 months on monthly plans

If you're running an agency, managing client contracts regularly, or coordinating document workflows across a team, the Pro plan removes all the friction. The AI Assistant alone is worth exploring—it can help summarise documents, extract key information, and speed up review processes considerably. Bulk Send is brilliant for anyone sending the same document to multiple recipients (think offer letters, NDAs, or standardised agreements).

Extra Perks & Features

**Mobile-Friendly:** Full functionality on smartphones and tablets. Sign documents on the go, review contracts during your commute, or approve workflows from literally anywhere.

**Team Collaboration:** Multiple users can work on the same document simultaneously. Comments, annotations, and suggestions keep everyone on the same page without endless email chains.

**Custom Branding:** Pro users can add their logo and brand colours to documents and signature requests, maintaining professional consistency across all client communications.

**Email Integration:** Send documents directly from Gmail or Outlook, track who's opened what, and receive notifications when signatures are completed.

**AI-Powered Assistance:** The new AI Assistant (available in Pro) can answer questions about your documents, extract specific data points, and even help draft responses based on document content.

**Reusable Templates:** Create document templates for recurring workflows. Perfect for contracts, invoices, forms, or any standardised paperwork you deal with regularly.

The combination of these features means DocHub isn't just replacing one tool in your stack—it's potentially replacing three or four. That's where the real value calculation comes in.

FAQs
----

**When does DocHub's Black Friday sale start and end?** The sale runs from 12th November through 3rd December 2025. It's a three-week window, so you've got plenty of time to make a decision, but don't leave it until the last minute—these things have a habit of selling out or ending early.

**Does the 20% discount apply to renewals?** If you choose a monthly plan during the sale, the 20% discount applies for 12 consecutive billing cycles (one full year). After that, the plan renews at the standard rate. Annual plans receive the discount on the first year only and renew at regular pricing thereafter.

**Do I need a special coupon code?** Nope! The 20% discount applies automatically when you purchase through the promotional period. Just visit the deal page, select your plan, and the discount will be reflected at checkout. No fumbling with coupon codes or promo fields.

**Is the Free plan also getting upgraded during the sale?** The Free plan remains as is—it's already free, after all! The 20% discount applies specifically to the Basic and Pro paid plans. However, you can always start with Free and upgrade mid-sale if you realise you need more capacity.

**Can I switch plans later if I start with Basic?** Absolutely. DocHub makes it easy to upgrade (or downgrade) between plans at any time. If you start with Basic during the Black Friday sale and later realise you need Pro features, you can switch seamlessly. Your discount structure will adjust based on when you made the original purchase.
